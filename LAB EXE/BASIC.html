<p>The tortoise and the hare were friends. The hare was very fast, and the tortoise was very slow. One day, they decided to have a race. The hare ran quickly and soon was far ahead. He thought the tortoise was too slow, so he stopped to take a nap. The tortoise kept walking slowly without stopping. While the hare was sleeping, the tortoise reached the finish line. When the hare woke up, he ran fast, but the tortoise had already won. This story teaches us that being slow but steady can help us succeed.</p>
